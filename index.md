## Welcome to the Github of Edgar Schafellner

Hi,

and welcome to my Github page! Thanks for stopping by :-)

My name is Edgar Schafellner and i am currently working for xxxldigital - the digital organizational unit of the XXXL Group. Therefore i am a support agent in our digital support department. Our support deparment is the main contact point for all our stakeholders. This is also includes close contact with our QA, project management and DEVs.

If you want to know more about our awesome department please visit our [website](https://www.xxxl.digital/about-en) :-) We are always on the lookout for new colleagues!

## About myself

As far as you know i am a support agent at xxxldigital, but i have not always a technically adepted person. I was studying Business and Economis at the JKU before I startet a career in the digital sector - so i am always up for a challenge and to learn new things. This is also the reason why this page exists - it was part of a training i have attended.
